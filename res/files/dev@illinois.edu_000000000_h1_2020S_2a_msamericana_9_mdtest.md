### Phrase Emphasis ###
Markdown:
    Some of these words *are emphasized*.
    Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
    Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
    Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

## Lists ##

and this:

    -   Candy.
    -   Gum.
    -   Booze.

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as
list markers:

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue

### Code ###

    I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
    instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of
the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,
and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.
