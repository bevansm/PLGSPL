### Phrase Emphasis ###
Markdown:
Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

## Lists ##

-  Red
-  Green
-  Blue

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as
list markers:

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue

### Code ###

    This is a code indent!

To specify an entire block of pre formatted code, indent every line of
the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,
and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.
